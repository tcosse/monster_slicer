Monster Slicer is a fun and short online game designed for casual gamers.

The game was hosted at https://www.monsterslicer.games/, but the site is now down.

The objective of the game is to slice as many monsters as you can and pick up coins.

You can see the demo video of the game [here](https://youtu.be/XK0nbuPuGio?t=3753&si=eP3UND6OS2eZNo4W).

The project is developped using the Ruby On Rails framework, JavaScript and the Phaser.JS library.

It was developped at Le Wagon by Eno Leroy, Arnaud Toulorge, Eliott Regnier and Thomas Coss√©.
